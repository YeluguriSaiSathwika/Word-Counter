# Word Counter

This is a simple Python program that counts the number of words in a given text. The project is designed to strengthen your understanding and application of Python programming concepts such as input handling, string manipulation, function creation, basic control flow, and output display.

## Project Overview

The Word Counter program prompts the user to enter a sentence or paragraph, counts the number of words in the input text, and displays the word count. The program includes error handling for empty input and provides a user-friendly interface.

## Features

- **User Input**: Prompts the user to enter a sentence or paragraph. This ensures that the program can process any text the user wishes to analyze.
- **Word Counting Logic**: Implements a function that counts the number of words in the input. The function splits the input text into words based on spaces and counts them.
- **Output Display**: Prints the word count to the console, providing immediate feedback to the user.
- **Error Handling**: Accounts for potential errors, such as empty input. If the user does not enter any text, the program will notify the user and prompt for input again.
- **Code Comments**: Adds comments to explain the purpose of different parts of the code. This makes the code easier to understand and maintain.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Ensures a clear and user-friendly interface for input and output, making the program easy to use even for those with minimal technical knowledge.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x: Make sure you have Python installed on your system. You can download it from [python.org](https://www.python.org/).
